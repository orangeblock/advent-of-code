# Description
Here you'll find my solutions for [Advent of code](http://adventofcode.com/).  
  
Each year is in it's own subdirectory and then a specific directory for each language. Currently I'm doing them in [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/), languages I'm trying to learn. With that in mind, enjoy... and expect the worst ;)
